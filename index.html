                I am a student web developer from the great city of Cleveland Ohio. It is very cold and icy here which makes it the perfect place to study. I go to the best bootcamp in town at Case Western Reserve University. The Monday Wednesday class is very small so we all get great individualized attention from the instructor, Max, and the TAs, Mike and Steve. Football season is over and the Cavaliers are awful right now without Lebron. Better Call Saul doesn't come back for a long time. That makes the only thing worth watching on TV to be Game of Thrones which doesn't come back until April. It is great that there is nothing to watch which forces me to study.

                My cat, Pinto, is the best creature on earth that helps me study. She is very quiet which makes it easy to focus. She snuggles right next to me and gives me moral support when coding goes rough. She is my best friend and there is no way I could do this without her. Everyone else is encouraging but they are too busy with important activities to be there for me like my cat.

                I hope to learn as much as I can from this course, my instructors and my peers. There is so much new and exiting information to learn!
